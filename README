=== EXECUTE ===

Binaries should be put in the 'bin/' directory. First launch the server by typing:

$ bin/server

You can specify an interface and a port to listen to (IPv4 and IPv6 are suported), and the number of clients who are allowed.


The display must be launch in the same context as the one of the 'img/' and 'music/' directories. You can run:

$ bin/display

You can specify a node and a port to connect to (IPv4 and IPv6 are suported).


Then, you can connect clients to the server. For example:

$ bin/client

As for the display, you can specify a node and a port to connect to (IPv4 and IPv6 are suported).


When the display and the desired number of clients have connected to the server, the simulation starts and the display begins its work.
